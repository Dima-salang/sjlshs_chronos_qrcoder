first, read the system prompt from gemini.md. ensure that you follow everything from that file.

the plan is to automate everything. 

first, i want you to make the importing of the class masterlist from the excel file to firebase
so that the devices can just pull from the firebase. follow the structure from the data importer and models.py

second, i would also want the pictures to be uploaded somewhere. recommend me a free storage service that we can use 
so that the devices can just pull them from that storage without manually uploading them to the devices.

third, i also want you to possibly make the uploading of the encryption key to firebase so that all devices can just pull it.
advise me on whether this is safe or not and what is the most safe on how to do this.

fourth, also fix the qr generation so that the generation of the qr is by section in the folder. so that it is Microsoft/2023108404/
in the folder directory instead of just 20231084/.

ensure that all of these are followed and correctly applied. ensure that everything is correct and bug free and that you are using standard
enginereing practices and industry standards so that everything is excellent and good. prioritize readability and performance as well maintainability.
